# Improvement log

Append-only. One entry per scheduled run, newest at the bottom.

This is the agent's memory. A fresh session reads it to find out what has
already been tried — including what was tried and **abandoned**, which is the
part that stops the loop from cycling. An entry recording "investigated X,
concluded it is fine, here is why" is as valuable as one recording a change.

## Entry format

```
## <ISO date> · run N · <one-line summary>

**Picked:** backlog item #N, or "scan only".
**Did:** what changed, in one paragraph a reviewer can check against the diff.
**Verify:** the result of `npm run verify`.
**PR:** #NNN, or "none — scan only".
**Learned:** anything the next run should know. Dead ends belong here.
**Next:** what the agent would pick up next, and why.
```

## Rules

- Never rewrite or delete a previous entry. Correct one by adding a new entry
  that says what the earlier one got wrong.
- If a run ends without opening a PR, it still writes an entry saying why.
  A silent run is indistinguishable from a broken schedule.
- If three consecutive runs fail to land anything, say so plainly in the entry
  and mark the blocking item `blocked`. Do not keep retrying the same approach.

## 2026-08-16 · run 0 · Loop established

**Picked:** n/a — setup.
**Did:** Created `docs/agent/backlog.md` and this log so that a scheduled agent
running every five hours accumulates knowledge instead of restarting from zero
each time. Seeded the backlog with six items, all `hypothesis`, drawn from a
structural read of `src/support/onboarding/dashboard-page.ts` and
`src/support/onboarding/dashboard.ts` — not from using the dashboard.
**Verify:** not run — documentation only.
**PR:** none — committed alongside setup.
**Learned:** Nothing in the backlog is evidenced yet. Item 1 exists precisely
because the other five are guesses made from source code, and guesses about UX
made from source code are usually wrong in the details that matter.
**Next:** Item 1. Drive the onboarding wizard as a first-time user and write
`docs/agent/journey-notes.md`. Everything else waits on that.

## 2026-08-16 · run 1 · Drove the onboarding wizard; half the backlog was wrong

**Picked:** backlog item 1 — map the onboarding journey.
**Did:** Ran `npm run onboard` and onboarded a real application (saucedemo,
`https://www.saucedemo.com`) end to end, twice — once in the order a first-time
user takes it, once deliberately re-ordered to isolate the marker-derivation
trap. Recorded every step, field, wait and dead end in
`docs/agent/journey-notes.md`, then rewrote `backlog.md` against it: eleven
ranked items, nine of them `ready` and observed rather than inferred, plus a
"Deleted guesses" section recording the five that use disproved. Removed the
scratch target with the dashboard's own remove flow and restored the repo.
**Verify:** `npm run verify` passes — 733 tests.
**PR:** see branch `agent/2026-08-16-journey-notes`.
**Learned:**

- **The backlog's own warning was right.** Three of the six seeded items were
  wrong, and one was backwards: the dashboard's failure messages are *better*
  than most of the framework, naming the file, the fix and often the exact
  command. Item 4 assumed the opposite. Reading `dashboard-page.ts` produced
  confident, wrong conclusions, exactly as the conventions predict.
- **The headline is not a UX problem, it is a bug.** `proposeSignedInMarker`
  never checks that the marker it derives is *unique* in the after-snapshot. On
  saucedemo it proposed `link "Sauce Labs Backpack"`, which matches the product
  image link and the product title link, so `setup:auth` dies on a strict-mode
  violation. `npm run onboard` does not deliver its stated aim —
  "`setup:auth` passes with no file edited by hand" — on a mainstream demo
  application. That is now item 1.
- **Order of operations is load-bearing and invisible.** Verify → Create writes
  the derived marker into the pack. Create → Verify reports the same marker and
  writes nothing, leaving the guess *and* a generated comment claiming
  verification was skipped. Both paths were run; the difference is real.
- **Dead end worth recording:** the offboarding flow needs nothing. It names
  every file, flags what git cannot restore, warns about the credential entries
  and refuses to act until the target's own name is typed. Do not spend a run
  on it.
- Method note: the screenshot tool was unavailable, so the journey was driven
  through the accessibility tree and the DOM. That was a better fit anyway —
  it is what `getByRole` reads.

**Next:** Item 1, the uniqueness check. It is the only item that makes the tool
fail at its stated job, it is pure and unit-testable from a pair of snapshot
strings, and it needs no target. Items 2–4 are the ordering trap and its
signposting and should follow as one or two small PRs. Items 10 and 11 came
from the owner mid-run and are `hypothesis` pending one decision from them —
recorded in the item.
