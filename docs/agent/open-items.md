# Open items

**The live worklist.** Everything here is unfinished. Finished items and the
reasoning behind them stay in [`backlog.md`](backlog.md), which is now an
archive of 30 items and is read for *why a thing was done*, not for what to do
next.

Split out on 2026-08-18, after `backlog.md` passed 1,900 lines and the four
items that were actually open were spread across it.

The working agreement — how a run starts, how it picks, branching and pushing,
the status vocabulary, the standing brief — is still in `backlog.md` and is
still binding. Read it there; it does not change often. Read this file to
decide what to do.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | A repeatable learn-fix-optimise loop over a full run | `hypothesis` |

**Nothing carries a `ready` label.** Items 38 and 41 to 42 all closed across
runs 46 to 50. The next run is either a **scan** — drive the dashboard and the
onboarding journey and raise what is found with evidence — or the **coverage
phase**, which is now much the largest body of work left: four of seven
applications are not onboarded, and 32 of 35 coverage cells are empty.

**Item 38 resolved itself in run 48.** The lockout cleared — `POST /users/login`
now answers **HTTP 200** — and toolshop is back to **20/20** live. Nothing in
this repository changed it, which is the point: the failure was left red and
legible rather than tailored around, and it went away on its own.

`npm run suites:live` runs every onboarded application's specs against the real
deployment, and **step 5 of the working agreement in `backlog.md` says every
run does this and records the result.**

### 11. A repeatable learn-fix-optimise loop over a full run — `hypothesis`

Full text: `backlog.md`, item 11. Two slices shipped (runs 12, 13).

**Standing objective, not a task.** The owner's stopping condition is "until the
entire solution meets the intent and it is bulletproof", so this closes when the
suites are, not when a list is empty.

**What is left:**

- A `toolshop` triage-fixture. **Ranked below the real suites**, and run 39b is
  the evidence: a fixture of deliberate failures is worth less than running the
  suite that is meant to pass. Run 41 shipped the running half
  (`npm run suites:live`), so this is now the smaller remaining piece.
- **Only 1 of the 7 rules in `rules.ts` has ever been settled against ground
  truth** (`transport-failure`). The other six have unit coverage on synthetic
  message text and no ground truth at all. That is the measurement's real blind
  spot and nobody had written it down before run 39b.

## The coverage phase

A separate, time-boxed piece of work with its own log:
[`coverage-phase.md`](coverage-phase.md). Five new applications alongside the
two already here, each taken end to end through happy path, negative,
idempotency, audit and boundary coverage, one at a time.

It is kept out of this file on purpose. It is a programme with its own
per-application state, and folding it in would put this list back where
`backlog.md` was.
